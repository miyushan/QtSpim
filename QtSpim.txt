$t0 to $t9	for temperory values
$s0 to $s7	for output values

addi for increment values

mult for multipile and give resut from HIGH and LOW registers

devide:
	remainder- HIGH
	quotient - LOW
	
lw:
	to get an value from a different kind of implementation
	
sw:
	(store word) is used to assign the address of a different value to another value
	
move:
	use to copy a value of a different number to another number easily
	
slt:
	(setOn less than) compare two values and output 1 if firstOne < SecondOne
	
slti:
	(setOn less than immediate) compare a values with another number and output 1 if value < number

beq:
	(branch_If_Equal)check two values are equal or not and call appropriate functions
	
bne:
